    "<br>\n",
    "A common technique is to deprioritize the most common words and prioritize less frequently used terms as topics in a process known as __term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf)__. The liblaries __gensim__ and __sklearn__ have modules to handle __tf-idf__.\n",

    "__Word2vec__ can map out your topic model results spatially as vectors so that similarly used words are closer together. Word-to-vector mapping are known as a word embedding."
